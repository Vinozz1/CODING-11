<!-- Once, in a distant past, he shared wisdom with me, climbing a mountain is not always to seek its beauty, tending a flower is not always to pluck it when it blooms. Likewise, loving someone isn't always to possess them

She taught me to cherish her true self,
Finding solace in the bond of friendship.
He showed me a flower's beauty
Unfaded by being left in bloom,
And that a rainbow's brilliance
Need not follow every storm.
In their wisdom, I learned
To guard my heart and nurture my soul,
Loving deeply but never losing myself. -->



In the garden of my life, you are the golden thread,
With wisdom profound and a heart widespread.
A beacon of kindness, a wellspring of light,
Your presence transforms the darkest night.

With tender care, you nurtured my soul,
Guiding with patience, making me whole.
A mind so brilliant, a spirit so wise,
In your counsel, true insight lies.

Your heart, pure gold, your kindness rare,
Strength honed with love and care.
Through life's trials and challenges faced,
You found your power in every step embraced.

Your lessons, treasures I hold so dear,
In your words, I found my cheer.
For all you've given, and all you've shown,
My gratitude in every seed you've sown.

Thank you, dear her nando, for the love you impart,
For shaping my mind and guarding my heart.
A mentor, a guide, my everlasting star,
In the universe of my soul, A shining light, my guiding star.
